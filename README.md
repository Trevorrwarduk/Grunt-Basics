# Grunt setup

A basic initial installation of Grunt.

The initial items set up are

### Watch
### jshint
### beautifier
### available tasks

This should be setup in the parent directory of the javaScript project, or you main workspace.

The 'Watch' task will check through all sub-directories from the parent down.

When installed run 'Grunt watch' from a terminal window and as the code is modified and saved it will be syntax checked and formatted.
